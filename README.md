# ft_linear_regression

A simple implementation of a linear regression algorithm to predict the price of a car based on its mileage.

🎯 Objective

- Understand the fundamentals of linear regression.
- Implement a supervised learning model without using a machine learning library.
- Be able to train a model from a simple dataset (.csv file).
- Evaluate the model performance using an error metric (such as MSE).
- Visualize the results via graphs (matplotlib or equivalent).

📌 Constraints

- The use of libraries like numpy and matplotlib is permitted only for mathematical calculations and visualization.
- The model must be trained from a CSV file containing two columns: mileage and price.

🧪 Usage

```bash
# install requirement
python -m pip install -r requirement.txt
# train the model
python model_training.py [-h] [-w] [-s] data
# predict price
python priceEstimate.py
```

🎓 Pedagogical objectives

- Discover the basics of machine learning through a simple practical case.
- Manipulate data files and process them in Python.
- Learn how to train a model and adjust its parameters (theta0, theta1) via gradient descent.
- Understand the concept of cost and how to optimize it.
- Learn how to visualize and interpret the results of a regression model.
